# License_plate
Liscense Plate detecting model.

This model is a state-of-the-art object detecting model built using Tensorflow's object dection API.
A retrained Faster RCNN is used to maximize performance and accuracy.

Tensorflow version required to run it is 1.14. 

Will not work with Tensorflow 2.0 or higer.
